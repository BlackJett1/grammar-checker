In this project, I practiced Array manipulation with .split(), .join(), .filter(), and .map(). Iteration methods such as .forEach(), .every(), and .findIndex() to loop through arrays and perform checks or modifications. Conditional logic to check and replace words or detect words that meet certain criteria. Debugging and logging using console.log() to inspect the state of arrays and values at different stages.

I used to counted the total number of words in the paragraph.
Using .filter(), I removed unnecessary words like "literally" to make the story clearer and more concise.
Using .map(), I corrected a misspelled word by checking each word and replacing "beautifull" with "beautiful".
